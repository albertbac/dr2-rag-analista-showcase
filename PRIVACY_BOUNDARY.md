# Privacy Boundary

## What was excluded
- Production source code
- Real user, patient, client, or institution data
- Raw operational payloads
- Private infrastructure references
- Internal logic that would weaken the product if exposed
- Real screenshots and live records

## Why it was excluded
The goal of this repository is public-safe positioning, not operational transparency. Anything that could expose confidential information or reduce product security was left out.

## What stays public
- Product framing
- High-level architecture
- High-level workflow
- Public-safe positioning text
- Manual screenshot guidance
- Manual metrics placeholders

## Why this limit exists
Provider routing, prompt policy, retrieval tuning, vector configuration, and deployment details remain private because they are part of the production operating layer.
